# Book-Tracker-Pro

## Description

Our project was created to provide a functional, interactive app for users to add books they have read and apply their own ratings. It is a web-based log that helps the user keep track of what books they have read and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5. Instead of having to keep a handwritten log, the user will be able to keep track on their app.
